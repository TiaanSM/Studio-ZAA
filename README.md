# Studio-ZAA Architecture website.
## Studio-ZAA is a website made for an architecture company to display the work they do and projects they have completed.
## The website design comes from an awwwards website.

### I built this website to:

1. Learn react js:

I learned how to structure JSX, use react router to change pages, intersection observer to trigger animations, 
react lazy import and suspense to improve performance, how to handle state and changes, reusable components to
improve speed of development and more.


2. Rebuilding a great design:

I built this website design because it was created by some of the top designers, I wanted to see if I could
rebuild it pixel perfect. I am happy with the end result, based on what I know today I believe I cann rebuild 
it better and within 10 days. The design is not normal and the use of side scrolling makes it feel modern and
different. I think this design is a great fit for the company it was designed for and is one of the reasons 
why I chose to build it.
